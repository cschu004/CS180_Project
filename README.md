#Introduction
------------
UCRInstagram is an application for the Android operating system that allows users to share pictures with other users through an Android mobile device. Users are able to write captions for each individual photo that they upload. Users also have their own personal profile page displaying their information such as their gender, birth date, bio, etc. They can also browse random photos and see which person is associated in uploading that photo. Users also have the ability to follow other users and receive updates as well as see the pictures that they upload.

#Features:
-----------
* Support GPS location labeling of the uploaded photo.
* Users should be able to add other user as friend. There should be a friend management page.
* Users can choose to only look at friends’ photos. Users should get noticed when a friend has updates.
* Users can collect photos to their “favorites”.
* Users can comment on photos. Users can set whether specific photos can be browsed and commented only by friends or all the others.
* Users can apply digital filters to their images, such as sharpening the image.
* Each user should have one’s own profile, including some personal information (profile photo, nickname, gender, profile creation date, birthday, etc.) and interested topics.
* Each user should be able to manage his/her own post board (upload, delete, describe, sort). Uploaded photos are directly   taken ones or ones already saved in the smartphone.
* Users can browse images in a page showing the thumbnails of the photos. When an image is clicked, one can see a bigger image and related information of the photo.
* Users can “look around” other randomly selected images.
